This could commoditize many current AI service businesses while creating massive opportunities for infrastructure and aggregation layers.
What is Model Control Protocol (MCP)? MCP serves as a standardized connector layer that sits between:
LLM applications (Claude, ChatGPT, custom AI agents) Data sources (databases, APIs, file systems) Tools and services (productivity apps, analysis tools, automation platforms) Think of MCP as creating universal &ldquo;pipes&rdquo; that allow any AI agent to connect to any data source or tool, regardless of the underlying technology stack.
