# WordPress to Hugo Migration Guide & Multi-Modal Content Workflow

## Migration Strategy Overview

### Content Organization Structure
```
content/
├── public-equity-investments/    # Market analysis, stock research, investment frameworks
├── sector-research/             # Fintech, Web3, DeFi, regulatory analysis  
├── philosophy-tech/             # Personal insights, tech philosophy, trend analysis
└── posts/                      # General blog posts and announcements

## Phase 1: Content Audit & Categorization

### Step 1: Export WordPress Content
```bash
# Use WordPress export tool or manual collection
# Your content falls into these categories:

### Step 2: Content Mapping Template
For each WordPress post, use this categorization:

```yaml

- Investment analysis/public markets → public-equity-investments/
- Fintech/Web3/DeFi sector analysis → sector-research/  
- Personal tech insights/philosophy → philosophy-tech/
- General announcements → posts/
```
