# NPST: The Hidden Fintech Stock with 600% Returns

**Bottom Line**: Network People Services Technologies (NPST) has delivered exceptional 600% returns in the past year, significantly outperforming Nifty Small Cap's ~50% returns. This payments technology company exemplifies how boring fintech infrastructure can generate phenomenal growth when executed correctly.

## Company Overview

**Network People Services Technologies Limited (NPST)** is a payment technology company listed on NSE as an SME stock. The company operates in two key segments:

### 1. Tech Infrastructure for Banks (TSP Services)
- Provides technology solutions for interoperable payments (UPI, IMPS, mobile banking)
- Connected with 14 banks including key partner Cosmos Bank
- Focus on underserved banking partners like Karnataka Rural Bank
- Offers online dispute resolution and merchant acquiring services

### 2. Payment Platforms as a Service
- Serves fintech companies and payment aggregators
- Provides connectors to fintechs like Jupiter, Decentro for UPI switch capabilities
- Competes with players like Razorpay (which recently entered this space via Airtel Payments Bank partnership)

## Financial Performance

The numbers tell an impressive story of consistent growth with profitability:

| Metric | FY23 Growth | FY24 Growth |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Revenue** | 2x | 3x |
| **Profit Before Tax** | 4x | ~4x |

**Management Guidance**: Targeting 75-100% Y-o-Y growth in FY25

## Valuation Analysis

Current trading multiple: **P/E of 150+**

This seemingly outlandish valuation is driven by:
- Lack of direct public sector peers
- Absence of quality analyst coverage  
- Low general awareness about the business model
- Sustained high-growth trajectory with profitability

## Market Context & Risks

### Banking-as-a-Service Challenges
The BaaS sector has faced headwinds globally:
- Collapse of Synapse in the US affected 100,000+ Americans with $265M in deposits
- Regulatory changes in card issuing rules impacted neo-banking infrastructure providers
- Investor skepticism about big outcomes from "fintech infra" plays

### Competitive Landscape
- Private market comparisons show difficulty finding sustainable 40-50% CAGR with positive cash flows
- M2P's potential exit could change investor perception of fintech infrastructure value

## Investment Thesis

**Why This Matters**: 
1. **Proven Business Model**: Years of building fintech infrastructure with close bank partnerships
2. **External Expansion**: Successfully serving fintech and direct merchant segments  
3. **Profitable Growth**: Rare combination of high growth with sustained profitability
4. **Market Position**: Strong positioning in underserved banking segments

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Strengths**:
- Exceptional financial performance with 600% stock returns
- Profitable growth trajectory with clear revenue visibility
- Established bank partnerships providing stable foundation
- Expansion into higher-growth fintech servicing

⚠️ **Risks**:
- Extremely high valuation multiples (P/E 150+)
- SME stock with limited liquidity
- Regulatory risk in payments sector
- Dependence on partner banks like Cosmos Bank

**Investment View**: While the growth story is compelling, the current valuation appears stretched. Suitable for investors comfortable with SME stock volatility and believing in continued fintech infrastructure growth.
