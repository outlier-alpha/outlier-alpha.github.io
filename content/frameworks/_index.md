# Investment Frameworks

Proven methodologies and analytical frameworks I use for investment analysis, due diligence, and strategic decision-making. These frameworks have been developed through 9+ years of experience across investment banking, venture investments, and strategic advisory.

## Featured Frameworks

### Early-Stage Investment Analysis
Systematic approach to evaluating early-stage ventures across market opportunity, business model, founding team, and execution risk.

### Public Market Stock Selection
Framework for identifying asymmetric opportunities in public markets with focus on fundamental analysis and sector rotation strategies.

### Financial Risk Assessment
Comprehensive risk evaluation methodology covering credit, market, operational, and regulatory risks.

### Strategic Due Diligence
End-to-end due diligence process for growth-stage investments including market analysis, competitive positioning, and scalability assessment.
